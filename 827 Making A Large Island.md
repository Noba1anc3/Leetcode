In a 2D grid of 0s and 1s, we change at most one 0 to a 1.

After, what is the size of the largest island? (An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s).

**Example:**
```
Input: [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Change one 0 to 1 and connect two 1s, then we get an island with area = 3.

Input: [[1, 1], [1, 0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Change the 0 to 1 and make the island bigger, only one island with area = 4.

Input: [[1, 1], [1, 1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Can't change any 0 to 1, only one island with area = 4.

```

## Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def largestIsland(self, grid):
        N = len(grid)

        def neighbors(r, c):
            for nr, nc in ((r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1)):
                if 0 <= nr < N and 0 <= nc < N:
                    yield nr, nc

        def dfs(r, c, index):
            ans = 1
            grid[r][c] = index
            for nr, nc in neighbors(r, c):
                if grid[nr][nc] == 1:
                    ans += dfs(nr, nc, index)
            return ans

        area = {}
        index = 2
        for r in range(N):
            for c in range(N):
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    area[index] = dfs(r, c, index)
                    index += 1

        ans = max(area.values() or [0])
        for r in range(N):
            for c in range(N):
                if grid[r][c] == 0:
                    seen = {grid[nr][nc] for nr, nc in neighbors(r, c) if grid[nr][nc] > 1}
                    ans = max(ans, 1 + sum(area[i] for i in seen))
        return ans
```
